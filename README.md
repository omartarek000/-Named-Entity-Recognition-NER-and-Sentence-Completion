# Named-Entity-Recognition (NER) and Sentence Completion

This project provides a web application that performs **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** and **Sentence Completion** using state-of-the-art natural language processing models from Hugging Face. The application is built with Streamlit to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in the input text.
- **Sentence Completion**: Predicts masked words in a given sentence, allowing for multiple [MASK] tokens.
- **Streamlit Integration**: A clean and interactive web interface for model interaction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Streamlit (for creating the web application)
- PyTorch (for running the models)
- Hugging Face `transformers` library
- Other required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/omartarek000/-Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-and-Sentence-Completion.git
    cd Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-and-Sentence-Completion
    ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

To run the project locally, use Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the web application in your default browser, where you can try out the NER and Sentence Completion functionalities.

## Instructions
