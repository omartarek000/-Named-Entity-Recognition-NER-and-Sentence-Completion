# Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentence Completion

This project implements a web application that performs Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Sentence Completion using state-of-the-art natural language processing models from Hugging Face. The application is built with Streamlit for an interactive user interface.

## Features

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies and classifies named entities (e.g., person names, organizations, locations) in input text.
- **Sentence Completion**: Predicts masked words in a given sentence, allowing for multiple masks.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application interface.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For accessing pre-trained NLP models.
- **Python 3.7+**

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NER-and-Sentence-Completion.git
   cd NER-and-Sentence-Completion
